The FortiSOAR™ MITRE ATT&CK Solution Pack (solution-pack-mitre-attack) enables users to use the information and knowledge base that’s provided by the MITRE ATT&CK Framework to its full extent. 

## Deploying the MITRE ATT&CK Framework Solution Pack

**Important**: Before you deploy the solution pack, ensure that you have deployed the FortiSOAR™ Incident Response Solution Pack ([solution-pack-incident-response](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/solution-pack-incident-response)).

The steps for deploying a solution pack are mentioned in the [Deploying a Solution Pack](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/how-tos/blob/main/DeployingASolutionPack.md) article.
